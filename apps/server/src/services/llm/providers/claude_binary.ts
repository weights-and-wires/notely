/**
 * Resolves the Claude Code CLI binary the Claude Agent provider drives.
 *
 * The provider runs in "bring-your-own-binary" mode: the ~250 MB native binary
 * that the SDK would otherwise bundle is stripped at install time (see
 * `ignoredOptionalDependencies` in the root pnpm-workspace.yaml), so we point
 * the SDK at the user's own installed CLI via
 * `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`. This keeps the server install lean and lets each
 * platform provide a binary that actually runs there (e.g. the nixpkgs wrapper
 * on NixOS, which needs no glibc/nix-ld shim — unlike the SDK's bundled ELF).
 *
 * Resolution order: the TRILIUM_CLAUDE_CODE_PATH override, then `claude` on
 * PATH. The resolved binary is probed with `--version` once so a broken/absent
 * install surfaces as a clear, actionable error instead of an opaque spawn
 * failure mid-chat.
