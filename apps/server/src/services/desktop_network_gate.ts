 * Paths that stay reachable on the desktop's loopback listener even when the user
 * has NOT enabled network access. These are same-machine integrations rather than
 * the web app:
 *  - `/mcp` — the MCP transport, which requires an ETAPI token on every request
 *    (see routes/mcp.ts), exactly like `/etapi`. The loopback Host check below applies on
 *    top of that token, which is why this middleware must stay mounted ahead of the MCP
 *    routes in app.ts. Note it is the loopback *bind* (see host.ts), not this gate, that
 *    keeps MCP off the LAN while network access is off — the check here only refuses a
 *    rebound Host on a connection that already reached the loopback listener.
 *  - `/api/clipper` — the web clipper endpoint the browser extension talks to.
 *  - `/etapi` — the token-authenticated External API used by local automation.
 *
 * Everything else (the SPA + login, `/share`, the authenticated `/api`, static
 * assets) is "web access to the desktop instance" and is served only once the user
 * opts into network access.
