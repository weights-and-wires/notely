# Importing data from other applications
Starting with version v0.104.0, Notely's importer was expanded to application-specific imports. Unlike the standard HTML or <a class="reference-link" href="Markdown.md">Markdown</a> import/export, these importers are tailored to support the features and note structure of a particular application.

## Supported applications

*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Microsoft%20OneNote.md">Microsoft OneNote</a>, by connecting to your account using Microsoft Graph.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Notion.md">Notion</a>, via a ZIP export.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Google%20Keep.md">Google Keep</a>, via a ZIP export from _Google Takeout_ (Keep has no dedicated export mechanism).
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Evernote.md">Evernote</a>, via an ENEX export.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Anytype.md">Anytype</a>, via a JSON export.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Importing%20data%20from%20other%20applications/Obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, via a ZIP of the vault.

## Importing data from another application

To import from an application, there are two ways to access the import dialog:

*   In the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>, right click on a note and select _Import into note_.
*   In the <a class="reference-link" href="../UI%20Elements/Note%20buttons.md">Note buttons</a> area, select _Import files_.

A list of supported applications will appear at the top, each with their own configuration. Simply click one and proceed with the on-screen instructions.
