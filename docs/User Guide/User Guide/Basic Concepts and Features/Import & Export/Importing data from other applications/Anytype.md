# Anytype
Starting with v0.104.0, Notely is able to import data from Anytype from JSON imports which preserve most of the formatting and the metainformation.

## Import process

The first step is to export the data from Anytype:

*   To export a single page:
    *   Select the page to export.
    *   Press the \[…\] at the top-right of the window and select _Export_.
    *   Ensure the following options are set:
        *   Export format: Any-Block
        *   File Format: JSON
        *   Zip archive: On
        *   Include linked objects: On
        *   Include files: On
        *   Include archived objects: On
*   To export an entire channel:
    *   Select the desired channel from the left bar.
    *   Underneath the channel icon in the left sidebar, press the name of the channel with an arrow and select _Channel Settings_.
    *   In the left sidebar, look for the _Integrations_ section and select _Export_.
    *   Press _Any-Block_.
    *   Ensure the following options are set:
        *   File Format: JSON
        *   Zip archive: On
        *   Include files: On
        *   Include archived objects: On

In Trilium Notes:

1.  In the <a class="reference-link" href="../../UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>, right click and select _Import into note_.
2.  In the _Import from_ section, select _Anytype_.
3.  Upload the ZIP.

> [!NOTE]
> Exporting collections individually can sometimes miss information that would otherwise be picked up from an export of the entire channel. The reason is that Anytype leaves out some information when exporting individual pages/collections.

## Supported features

The following features are preserved by Trilium during the import process:

*   Basic formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, headings, colors, highlights, inline code).
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Text/Lists.md">Lists</a> (numbered or bullet)
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Text/Images.md">Images</a> and files are handled as <a class="reference-link" href="../../Notes/Attachments.md">Attachments</a>.
*   To-do lists
*   Toggle sections
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Text/Tables.md">Tables</a>
*   Inline <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a>

*   Highlight blocks are imported as block quotes.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Text/Developer-specific%20formatting/Code%20blocks.md">Code blocks</a>, with a best-effort attempt to restore the language.
*   Links between other imported pages are converted to <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/Text/Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a> if they are part of the same import.
    *   Applies to both block links and inline links.
*   Collections are imported as Trilium-native <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections.md">Collections</a> (see below).
    *   Files inside collections are imported as <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Note%20Types/File.md">File</a> notes.
*   Dividers (line, dots) are imported as horizontal rules.
*   [Admonitions](../../../Note%20Types/Text/Block%20quotes%20%26%20admonitions.md) are preserved, including its emoji (added as part of the content).
*   Creation and modification date of pages is preserved.

## Collections

Collections created in Anytype are imported on a best-effort basis, preserving both the view mode and the page properties as <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Advanced%20Usage/Attributes/Promoted%20Attributes.md">Promoted Attributes</a>.

The following view modes are supported:

*   List as <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections/List%20View.md">List View</a>
*   Gallery as <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections/Grid%20View.md">Grid View</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections/Calendar.md">Calendar</a>, preserving the attribute which identifies the date.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections/Kanban%20Board.md">Kanban Board</a>, preserving the board group column.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="../../../Collections/Table.md">Table</a>, also used as fallback for unsupported collection layouts.

The following types are supported:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">Anytype property type</th>
            <th scope="col">Trilium</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Text / Select</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>File</td>
            <td>The files are preserved as attachments, and a link to them is prepended to the content of the note for visibility.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Checkbox</td>
            <td><code spellcheck="false">boolean</code> label (<code spellcheck="false">true</code>/<code spellcheck="false">false</code>).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

## Reporting issues

When importing your Anytype notes, you might find issues in how a note is imported; in that case consider [reporting](../../../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md) it.

When reporting such an issue make sure to provide the following information:

*   A .zip export of the original note (and children if applicable). This allows us to reproduce the issue.
*   A screenshot with how it originally looked like before the import and how it looks after the import.
