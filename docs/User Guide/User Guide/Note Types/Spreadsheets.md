# Spreadsheets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Spreadsheets are a new type of note introduced in v0.103.0 and are currently considered experimental/beta. As such, expect major changes to occur to this note type.

Spreadsheets provide a familiar experience to Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, with support for formulas, data validation and text formatting.

## Spreadsheets vs. collections

There is a slight overlap between spreadsheets and the <a class="reference-link" href="../Collections/Table.md">Table</a> collection. In general the table collection is useful to track meta-information about notes (for example a collection of people and their birthdays), whereas spreadsheets are quite useful for calculations since they support formulas.

Spreadsheets also benefit from a wider range of features such as data validation, formatting and can work on a relatively large dataset.

## Data intercompatibility (import/export)

Starting with v0.104.0, Notely provides a level of data intercompatibility between the internal format (Univer) and the following formats:

*   Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
    *   Preserves basic formatting (fonts, sizes, borders, backgrounds).
    *   Formulas are preserved, but note that not all Excel functions are supported and vice-versa with Univer.
    *   Images (cell-bound or floating), without preserving rotation.
    *   Supports multi-sheets natively.
*   Comma-Separated Values (.csv)
    *   Since it's a text-based format, any formatting is lost.
    *   Formulas are evaluated and turned into their final value instead.
    *   Multi-sheets spreadsheets are exported as a single ZIP containing a CSV file per sheet.

Both [import and export](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Import%20%26%20Export.md) are supported, as follows:

*   To import a file, simply drag it into the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and it will be converted into a spreadsheet note.
    *   To avoid this behavior (e.g. to import a .xlsx file as an actual <a class="reference-link" href="File.md">File</a>), uncheck the corresponding option in the [Import dialog](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Import%20%26%20Export.md).
    *   Multiple files can be imported at the same time, including a mixture of .csv and .xlsx files. Folder structure can be preserved by using a .zip file.
*   Unlike importing, exporting is on a per-note basis:
    *   In the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20buttons.md">Note buttons</a>, choose the _Export to Excel_ or _Export to CSV_ options for the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/New%20Layout.md">New Layout</a>.
    *   For the old layout, choose the corresponding buttons in the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Floating%20buttons.md">Floating buttons</a> area.
    *   If exported as a single file via <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Import%20%26%20Export.md">Import &amp; Export</a>, the resulting file will be a custom `.triliumsheet` file that preserves the spreadsheet as-is.
        *   The export is intentionally a different process than the normal <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Import%20%26%20Export.md">Import &amp; Export</a> functionality because it does conversion to multiple formats with varying degrees of compatibility.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Import & export for both .xlsx and .csv files are supported on a best-effort basis. It does not support advanced features (data validation, scripting, etc.). If you notice a particular issue, it can be [reported](../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md), however all bug reports must contain a sample file in order to be taken into consideration.

## Supported features

The spreadsheet has support for the following features:

*   Since v0.104.0, images that can be either inside a cell or floating above.
    *   The images are saved as <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Attachments.md">Attachments</a> for performance reasons.
    *   The image upload respects the same compression settings as text <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Images.md">Images</a>.
*   Filtering
*   Sorting
*   Data validation
*   Conditional formatting
*   Notes / annotations
*   Find / replace

We might consider adding [other features](https://docs.univer.ai/guides/sheets/features/filter) from Univer at some point. If there is a particular feature that can be added easily, it can be discussed over [GitHub Issues](../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md).

### Share functionality

Spreadsheets can be [shared](../Advanced%20Usage/Sharing.md), case in which a best-effort HTML rendering of the spreadsheet is done:

*   Preserves basic formatting.
*   Cells with formulas display the precalculated value instead of the formula.

Since v0.104.0:

*   Numbers and dates are properly formatted.
*   Images are shown inside a cell or floating above, including rotation.

For more advanced use cases, this will most likely not work as intended. Feel free to [report issues](../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md), but keep in mind that we might not be able to have a complete feature parity with all the features of Univer.

## Features not supported yet

### Regarding Pro features

Univer spreadsheets also feature a [Pro plan](https://univer.ai/pro) which adds quite a lot of functionality such as charts, printing, pivot tables, export, etc.

As the Pro plan needs a license, Trilium does not support any of the premium features. Theoretically, pro features can be used in trial mode with some limitations, we might explore this direction at some point.

### Planned features

There are a few features that are already planned but are not supported yet:

*   Trilium-specific formulas (e.g. to obtain the title of a note).
*   User-defined formulas
*   Cross-workbook calculation

If you would like us to work on these features, consider [supporting us](https://triliumnotes.org/en/support-us).

### Mobile support

Versions prior to v0.104.0 have no dedicated mobile support, which means that the interaction is difficult without a mouse and keyboard. Starting with v0.104.0 we integrate Univer's mobile plugin, which introduces feature such as drag to pan which makes the interface more usable on mobile.
