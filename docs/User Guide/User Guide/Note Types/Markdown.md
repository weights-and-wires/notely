# Markdown
Notely has always supported Markdown through its [import feature](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Import%20%26%20Export/Markdown.md), however the file was either transformed to a <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> note (converted to Notely's internal HTML format) or saved as a <a class="reference-link" href="Code.md">Code</a> note with only syntax highlight.

This note type is a split view, meaning that both the source code and a preview of the document are displayed side-by-side. See <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20types%20with%20split%20view.md">Note types with split view</a> for more information.

## Rationale

The goal of this note type is to fill a gap: rendering Markdown but not altering its structure or its whitespace which would inevitably change otherwise through import/export.

Even if Markdown is now specially treated by having a preview mechanism, Notely remains at its core a WYSWYG editor so Markdown will not replace text notes.

> [!NOTE]
> Feature requests regarding the Markdown implementation will be considered, but if they are outside the realm of Notely, they will not be implemented. One of the core aspects of the Markdown integration is that it reuses components that are already available through other features of the application.

## Features

### Source view pane

*   Syntax highlighting for the Markdown syntax.
*   Nested syntax highlighting for code inside code blocks.
*   When editing larger documents, the preview scrolls along with the source editor.

### Preview pane

The following features are supported by Notely's Markdown format and will show up in the preview pane:

*   All standard and GitHub-flavored syntax (basic formatting, tables, blockquotes).
*   Basic HTML is also supported (e.g. collapsible blocks using `<details>` and `<summary>`).
*   Code blocks with syntax highlight.
    
    *   The language must be specified for syntax highlight to be applied (e.g. ` ```js `).
    *   Code blocks will respect the text wrapping from the <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> section in <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Options.md">Options</a>.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Block%20quotes%20%26%20admonitions.md">Block quotes &amp; admonitions</a>
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Math%20Equations.md">Math Equations</a> (both inline and block)
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Mermaid%20Diagrams.md">Mermaid Diagrams</a> using ` ```mermaid `
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Include%20Note.md">Include Note</a> (no built-in Markdown syntax, but HTML syntax works just fine):
    
    ```html
    <section class="include-note" data-note-id="vJDjQm0VK8Na" data-box-size="expandable">
        &nbsp;
    </section>
    ```
    
    *   These can also be quickly created via the `/include` command or via a dedicated keyboard shortcut (not assigned by default).
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Links/Internal%20(reference)%20links.md">Internal (reference) links</a> via its HTML syntax, or through a _Wikilinks_\-like format (only <a class="reference-link" href="../Advanced%20Usage/Note%20ID.md">Note ID</a>):
    
    ```
    [[Hg8TS5ZOxti6]]
    ```
*   To-do lists with extended task states:
    
    <table class="ck-table-resized" style="border-style:none">
        <colgroup>
            <col style="width:80.6%;">
            <col style="width:19.4%;">
        </colgroup>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><pre><code class="language-text-x-markdown">- [ ] None
    - [/] Doing
    - [X] Done
    - [?] Maybe
    - [-] Cancelled</code></pre></td>
                <td><figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img style="aspect-ratio:218/221;" src="Markdown_image.png" width="218" height="221"></figure></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    Task states are customizable: you can reorder them, create new ones with different colors and symbols, or delete the ones you don't need. See <a class="reference-link" href="../Advanced%20Usage/Customizing%20to-do%20task%20states.md">Customizing to-do task states</a> for more details.
    
    Note that to-do items with task states other than "None" and "Done" are Trilium-specific and may not work well with other Markdown software.
*   <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Footnotes.md">Footnotes</a> are also supported via the corresponding Markdown syntax:
    
    ```
    This is [^1], while this is [^2].
    
    [^1]: the first footnote
    [^2]: the second footnote
    ```
    
    *   These can also be quickly created using the `/footnote` command.
*   Page breaks for <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Printing%20%26%20Exporting%20as%20PDF.md">Printing &amp; Exporting as PDF</a>:
    
    ```
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    ```
*   Highlights (background color) are supported both via the `==` Markdown syntax, as well as the canonical HTML representation in Trilium:
    
    ```
    ==highlighted==
    <span style="background-color:hsl(0,0%,100%);">Highlighted</span>
    ```

### Links

Multiple types of links are supported:

*   Web URLs can be written with the standard Markdown syntax:
    
    ```
    [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org)
    ```
*   [Reference link](Text/Links/Internal%20\(reference\)%20links.md) to other notes with dynamic title, either by manually entering the note ID or via the _Add link_ dialog:
    
    ```
    [[B9oMG6rFvvfq]]
    ```
*   [Reference link](Text/Links/Internal%20\(reference\)%20links.md) to other notes with a custom text:
    
    ```
    [This is a link](#root/LhtnZxtVsUMp)
    ```

To create a link, either:

*   Type it manually using the syntax described above.
*   Use the _Add link_ dialog by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> or typing the `/link` command.

<a class="reference-link" href="Text/Link%20Previews.md">Link Previews</a> are also rendered, but there is no mechanism to insert them automatically as of now, they have to be copied from a <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> note instead.

### Keyboard shortcuts

The Markdown notes share some of the keyboard shortcuts from <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> notes:

*   _Cut to note_ (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>) which cuts the selection into a new child note.
*   _Add link_ (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>) which shows the dialog to create external or reference links.
*   _Insert date/time_ (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) which respects the same formatting as text notes.
*   _Include note_ (not assigned by default), which triggers the same dialog to insert notes as the one for text notes.

In addition, the following formatting keyboard shortcuts are available:

*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to toggle **bold**.
*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> to toggle _italic_.
*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> to wrap the current selection in an inline math (`$`).
*   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to toggle ~~strikethrough~~.

### Images & attachments

Images can be inserted into the document in four different methods:

*   Drag & drop directly into the editor area.
*   Pasting an image from clipboard.
*   Pasting a reference to another [attachment](../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/Notes/Attachments.md) (e.g. _Copy reference to clipboard_ button).
*   Use the `/image` slash command.

An image reference to an attachment looks like this:

```
![Name.jpeg](api/attachments/z50RceuHXe9J/image/image)
```

### Auto-completion

#### Slash commands

Just like <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> notes, Markdown notes support a selection of slash commands:

*   Inserting the current date & time (`/date`).
*   [Including](Text/Include%20Note.md) another note (`/include`).
*   Uploading and inserting an image (`/image`).
*   Inserting a note link (`/link`).
*   Inserting a math equation block (`/math`).
*   Inserting a [footnote](Text/Footnotes.md) (`/footnote`).
*   Inserting a [Mermaid](Mermaid%20Diagrams.md) diagram (`/mermaid`), with one variant per sample template (e.g. `/mermaid:flowchart`).
*   Inserting a collapsible block (`/collapsible`).
*   Inserting a page break for printing (`/page-break`).
*   Inserting a table (`/table`).
*   Creating admonitions (e.g. `/tip`, `/note`, `/important`, `/caution`, `/warning`).
*   Inserting task items (`/todo:<state>`, e.g. `/todo:done`), one per configured task state.
*   Inserting code snippets (`/snippet:<name>`) from your Markdown/plain-text snippet notes.

Note that slash commands only work outside of code blocks and inline code.

#### Code block language auto-completion

Starting with v0.104.0, typing \`\`\` to insert a code block will automatically open a list of suggested language types which have syntax highlighting.

The list of languages matches the one for <a class="reference-link" href="Code.md">Code</a> notes set in <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Options.md">Options</a>, it's not the full list of languages supported by Trilium.

### Other features

*   The <a class="reference-link" href="Text/Table%20of%20contents.md">Table of contents</a> will be displayed in the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Right%20Sidebar.md">Right Sidebar</a> based on the Markdown-level headings.
    *   This feature is available only on the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/New%20Layout.md">New Layout</a>.

### Shared notes

When a Markdown note is [shared publicly](../Advanced%20Usage/Sharing.md), it will be rendered with extended formatting just like <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> notes.

Most of the features described previously should be supported. If you face any issues, feel free to [report it](../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md) alongside a sample Markdown file.

## Creating Markdown notes

There are two ways to create a Markdown note:

1.  Create a new note (e.g. in the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a>) and select the type _Markdown_, just like all the other note types.
2.  Create a note of type <a class="reference-link" href="Code.md">Code</a> and select as the language either _Markdown_ or _GitHub-Flavored Markdown_. This maintains compatibility with your existing notes prior to the introduction of this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no distinction between the new Markdown note type and code notes of type Markdown; internally both are represented as <a class="reference-link" href="Code.md">Code</a> notes with one of the following MIME types:
> 
> *   `text/markdown`
> *   `text/x-markdown`
> *   `text/x-gfm` (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

## Import/export

### Import

By default, when importing a single Markdown file it automatically gets converted to a <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> note. To avoid that and have it imported as a Markdown note instead:

*   Right click the <a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Note%20Tree.md">Note Tree</a> and select _Import into note_.
*   Select the file normally.
*   Uncheck _Import HTML, Markdown and TXT as text notes if it's unclear from the metadata_.

When importing a Trilium ZIP, it will preserve the Markdown type without converting to text notes thanks to the meta-information in it.

### Exporting

When exporting Markdown files, the extension is preserved and the content remains the same as in the source view (with some small exceptions such as handling of attachments).

When exporting Markdown files as ZIP, choosing HTML or Markdown as the export format makes no difference as that only affects <a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> notes.

If the Markdown note contains attachments, a ZIP export will rewrite the links to attachments so that they are replaced with a relative path to the attachment. On import, the links are re-written back.

## Conversion between text notes and Markdown notes

<a class="reference-link" href="Text.md">Text</a> notes can be converted into Markdown notes and vice versa. See <a class="reference-link" href="Converting%20between%20note%20types.md">Converting between note types</a>.

## Sync-scrolling & block highlight

When scrolling through the editing pane, the preview pane will attempt to synchronize its position to make it easier to see the preview.

In addition, the block in the preview matching the position of the cursor in the source view will appear slightly highlighted.

The sync is currently one-way only, scrolling the preview will not synchronize the position of the editor.

This feature cannot be disabled as of now; if the scrolling feels distracting, consider temporarily switching to the editor mode and then switching to preview mode when ready.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature of synchronizing the scroll is based on blocks but it's provided on a best-effort basis since our underlying Markdown library doesn't support this feature natively, so we had to implement our own algorithm. Feel free to [report issues](../Troubleshooting/Reporting%20issues.md), but always provide a sample Markdown file to be able to reproduce it.
