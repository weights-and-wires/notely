# Reverse proxy configuration
It might be desirable to only expose the share functionality of Notely to the Internet, and keep the application accessible only within a local network or via VPN.

To do so, a reverse proxy is required.

## Caddy

```
http://domain.com {
  reverse_proxy /share http://localhost:8080/share
}
```

This is for newer versions where the share functionality is isolated, for older versions it's required to also include `/assets`.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fn2b8mg20aol8)
