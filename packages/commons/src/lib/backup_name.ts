/**
 * What a backup is called when the user has not said.
 *
 * Shared because every platform writes the same kind of file for the same reason, and a user who
 * takes one from the desktop and one from a browser should not have to work out that the two are
 * the same thing. The name has to survive being a filename on every one of them, so it holds no
 * colons and nothing else Windows refuses.
 *
 * @param now the moment the backup was asked for, passed in so the caller decides what "now" is.
